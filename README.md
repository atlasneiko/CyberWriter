# CyberWriter

A typewriter web app for writing short stories with a cyberpunk twist. It will only allow the contenof the current story up to 5000 words. While it still serves as a regular text editor app, this apwill also respond to every keystroke by calculating combo count and make the screen brighter with morneon light effects. It will take into account the following factors:

1. how often the user is typing
2. total paragraph count and average paragraph length
3. how long the current story is
4. if the delete/backspace key is pressed, it will generate a set back on the light effec
   This app is designed to encourage writers to write as fast as possible without trying to make eversingle keystroke perfect. It's a text editor that gamifies the writing process.
